    <p><h3>syntax</h3>
<p> which makes the expression of certain concepts easier or harder or uglier… Some languages require a lot more “boiler plate”
</p>
    
<h3>compiled vs. interpreted</h3>
    <p>
 or byte compiled into a virtual machine like JVM (Java Virtual Machine. Trade of off runtime vs. development time.
strong or weakly typed - rigor vs. flexibility/ease of programming
    </p>
<h3>memory management</h3>
    <p>
explicit (bookkeeping that the programmer has to carefully manage) or implicit (garbage collection)
